# Python automatic "Kudo" script

Simple Python script to automatically give : "min kudos" to new video's uploaded to dumpert.nl involving tags with "voetbal".
The next step is running the script through Tor Browser and changing my IP every 30 seconds. This would give the possibilty to harness 1300 exit-IP's of the Tor network making it possible to give up to 1300 Plus/Minus Kudo's per video.
